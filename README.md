# Whale Song Memory Game

This memory game is modeled after the classic [Simon (game)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Simon_%28game%29). The goal of the user experience is to have fun while learning about the distinct differences of whale calls between various whale species.  This game will hopefully inspire its users to stop and appreciate the musical notes of whale songs and gain an interest in saving our oceans for future generations. An excellent learning resource for learning about the impact of ocean noise on these majestic animals please watch the film, [Sonic Sea](https://www.sonicsea.org/).

  ## Design

  The game is designed to be fun and light-hearted to help engage the player in learning. The following design choices were made with this in mind:

  - ### Fonts


    - The primary font ['FishOutOfWater'](https://www.fontbros.com/families/fish-out-of-water) by [Font Bros](https://www.fontbros.com/) was chosen for the game title and results popup text message because it has a fun cartoon-like water quality to create an alternate game reality representation of whale's natural habitat.
    - The secondary font ['Michroma'](https://fonts.google.com/?query=michroma) by [Google Fonts](https://fonts.google.com/) was chosen for the game controls, score board and game instructions because of its digital, futuristic quality to represent the digital game environment.
  - ### Colors


    - The primary colors are calm ocean colors of light blue, medium and dark blue. In contrast to the ocean blues, the game action color is yellow orange. It highlights the game tiles when in use and outlines the 'start game' button. This bright color is used to guide the player to take action and play the game.
  - ### Styling


    - A cute cartoon whale is used as a graphic in the game results popup to make it fun for the player regardless of winning or losing the game.
  - ### Backgrounds


    - An animated ocean wave background provides an aquatic backdrop for the main game area and for the game results popup message.
  - ### Card images


    - Real photos were chosen for the primary game buttons, to represent individual whale species living in their real life natural environment. This documentary feel of the game is to encourage game players to continue their education of whale song beyond the game.
  - ### Audio files


    - Real audio recordings of whale songs were chosen to facilitate the learning experience discovering the nuanced differences of whale song between various whale species. They have been edited down to 1 second each so the game experience is fluid and rythmic.
    - An uplifting chime sound effect is heard with a popup game results message to celebrate the player winning the game!
    - A down-trodden chime sound effect plays with a losing popup message to alert the player that they lost the game.
  - ### Wireframes

    These wireframes were created using [Balsamiq](https://balsamiq.com/) to facilitate a mobile first responsive game site design. The game design evolved beyond the wireframes during testing phase explained below in the 'Testing' section.

    A flow chart was drawn to map out Javascript order of functionality.

  ### Testing User Stories from User Experience (UX) Section

  1. Game Controls

     1. The large 'start game' button shown in wireframes was tested but tossed because it was redundant in functionality similar to 'game restart' button developed later. The latter was converted to a 'game start' button and positioned beneath the game board. The new button is highlighted in orange yellow to grab the player's attention to begin the game. This clears up original confusion for the first time player, by the use of only one button to start and restart the game when necessary. The game board design is now cleaner without the original large 'game start' button overlayed on top as originally shown in wireframes.
     2. The 'how-to-play' button was a dropdown card with game instructions and was originally located at the top of the game area beneath the header but the location and design confused the player because it looked like part of the header and not an actual game button. To remedy the player confusion, the game instructions was reduced in size and positioned to the right of the 'start game' button beneath the game board for easy access. It's design is identical to the 'start game' button so the player knows to click on it to show a nifty popover message displaying a short list of game instructions. A dim blue outline was added to the 'how-to-play button so that its design does not compete with the more important 'start game' yellow/orange outlined button.
  2. Game Board

     1. When tested, the first time player encountered game visibilty issues in mobile view. The bootstrap grid applied to the game board, wrapped the game tiles in one single column in mobile view. This type of responsiveness detracted from the quality of the game experience because of having to use scroll bars to play the game on a mobile device. The initial wireframe design of using the identical game layout for all screen types was key to making the game fully functional on mobile, tablet and desktops. Media Queries were added to css to maintain the square game board layout on all device screen sizes.
     2. Original whale sounds were varying length and overlapped while playing, making it confusing for the first time player to identify a singular whale sound unique to each whale. To remedy the audio overlap, whale call raw files were edited down and audio mixed in Adobe Premiere Pro to 1-second durations to help simplify and build momentum during the audio playback game experience.
  3. Score Board

     1. The orignal score board also updated in real time, diplaying the round the player was on and also displyed text indicating whether the player won or lost the game. It was very basic and the player wasn't clear if they had won or lost the game. To make the game more fun and dynamic by notifying the player in a bolder way if they won or lost, a visually beautiful popup results diplay was added and solved this issue. Adding sound effects, a cute whale icon, an animated wave and different messages to notify the player if they had won or lost the game made a huge difference in the player having fun with the game. A third 'great!' button was added so the user can click it to make the results popup window disappear and return to the game board. The orignal score board remains below the game control buttons and still updates in real-time, the round the player is on but now it does no longer display's' a win or lose message.  These feature updates, sound effects, beautiful animation improves user interaction and creates a more engaging user game experience.

  ### Further Testing

  - The Website was tested on Google Chrome, Internet Explorer, Microsoft Edge and Safari browsers.
  - The website was viewed on a variety of devices such as Desktop, Laptop, iPhone7, iPhone 8 & iPhoneX.
  - Friends and family members were asked to review the site and documentation to point out any bugs and/or user experience issues.

  ### Known Bugs

  - Title font:'FishOutOfWater'by [Font Bros](https://www.fontbros.com/) would not load after adding link: @font-face with url for Font Bros to style.css.

    - Bug was squashed by adding WOFF files to Whale Song game site repository directory and update the css code to:

      ```css

       @font-face {
          font-family: 'FishOutOfWater';
          font-weight: normal;
          font-style: normal;
          font-display: swap;
          url("/fonts/FishOutOfWater-Regular.woff") format("woff");
      }

      @font-face {
          font-family: 'FishOutOfWater';
          font-weight: bold;
          font-style: normal;
          font-display: swap;
          url("/fonts/FishOutOfWater-Bold.woff") format("woff");
      }

      @font-face {
          font-family: 'FishOutOfWaterDemiBold';
          font-weight: normal;
          font-style: normal;
          font-display: swap;
          url("/fonts/FishOutOfWater-Demibold.woff") format("woff");
      }



      ```

    #### Bugs to fix in the next version


    - When the site reloads, the game results popup screen covers the game board.
    - Sometimes the game plays several game tiles at the same time after clicking on the game
    - When one game tile is to be played more than once in succession, the game tile only highlights once. Nonetheless it is still easy to play the game.
    - The yellow orange game tile border needs style improvements so that the border is more solid.

  ### Additional Features to add in the next version

  - 'High Score' box to record and save player high scores.
  - Add a game difficulty setting so the player may choose how many rounds they want to play to win.
  - Add more sound effects and visuals on game start to make it more fun and exciting.
